# Interview Experience for Data Engineer (Big Data) - 2021:  
### First Round:

+ What is Hive metastore?  
+ Hive external table vs managed table.  
+ evalute Programming skills - one question on that.  
+ mappers and reducers in Spark execution flow.  
+ what are `groupByKey` and `reduceByKey` operations in Spark.  
+ Write spark skeleton code for given scenario - reading a CSV and do some transformations on it - Code doesn't have to be exact but steps matter.  
+ Given a requirement (find the second largest value of a column for every value of other column - Window functions in SQL), what are the steps to achieve it using only spark-sql without dataframes/RDDs API in spark?
+ Questions on SQL for window functions in spark (SQL query is preferred compared to Dataframes API).
