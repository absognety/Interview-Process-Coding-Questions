# Interview Process For Vimeo - 2024:  
## First Round  
+ Coding Test with Interviewers present to observe, on Qualified Platform (https://www.qualified.io/).
+ SQL section (5 Questions) and Python section (5 Questions), 25 minutes for each section. There is a hard stop when 25 mins is over for each section.  
+ Python programming section covers questions from Arrays, Linkedlists and Trees and Tree Traversals (Medium Level).
+ SQL questions involve Advanced SELECT and JOINS.

Questions are subject to change with each test, but the format is likely to remain same, but who knows? :blush: :grin:
