# Personal Experience - Software Development Engineer - II (Data and ML Platform):  
  
## First Round (Computer Science Fundamentals and DSA):   
- Let's assume there are N number of lines in 2D coordinate system and their start and end points - `(X1s,X1e),(X2s,X2e),......(XNs,XNe) where s = start and e = end`, we need to draw a line perpendicular to X-axis (Parallel to Y-axis) such that the intersects maximum number of given lines and also find the points of intersection if possible (If multiple intersection points possible - return any of them).  
- Find the second largest element in an array?
- When does the shuffling happen in spark?
- what's your inference on the scenario where the application is running and memory consumption is too high and CPU utilization is constant?
- what are `coalesce` and `repartition` in Spark?
- How does the parallelism happen in Python? Methods to deal with and questions on relevant libraries?  

## Second Round (DSA):  
- Code up a linkedlist with all necessary operations from scratch!  
- Questions on developed linkedlist code, execution and manipulations to the code for some questions.  
- Find the middle element of the linkedlist.  
- Detect a cycle in the linkedlist if present.
- Doubly linkedlists and cyclic linkedlists - Questions only (No need to implement).  
- Questions on Internals of Spark and performance related questions.
