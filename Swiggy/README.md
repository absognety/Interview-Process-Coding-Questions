## First Round (Computer Science Fundamentals and DSA):  
1. Coding Question:  
   - Let's assume there are N number of lines in 2D coordinate system and their start and end points - `(X1s,X1e),(X2s,X2e),......(XNs,XNe) where s = start and e = end`, we need to draw a line perpendicular to X-axis (Parallel to Y-axis) such that the intersects maximum number of given lines and also find the points of intersection if possible (If multiple intersection points possible - return any of them).  
   - Find the second largest element in an array?
   - When does the shuffling happen in spark?
   - what's your inference on the scenario where the application is running and memory consumption is too high and CPU utilization is constant?
   - what are `coalesce` and `repartition` in Spark?
   - How does the parallelism happen in Python? Methods to deal with and questions on relevant libraries?
