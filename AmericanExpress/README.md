# Interview Process for Engineer - II (2021) (Personal):  
### First Round - Coding Round: Online Coding Round with time management.  
### Second Round - Design:  
+ Design an Application that serves machine learning model results in real-time (Design a feedback ingestion system and notifications pusher) - Brush upon 
system design concepts, NoSQL Databases, caching, load balancer frameworks, distributed computing fundamentals, APIs, software design patterns.  

### Third Round - Technical:  
+ Implement KNN (K-Nearest neighbors) algorithm at scale - Start from scratch - Try to think of solution that doesn't rely on existing cluster computing frameworks 
like spark, Dask etc - performance and efficient design matters!  - very good question, completely depends on the distributed and parallel processing paradigms and 
operating systems knowledge.
